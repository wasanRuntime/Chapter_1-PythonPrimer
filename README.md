R-1.1 Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two integer
values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.

R-1.2 Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.
