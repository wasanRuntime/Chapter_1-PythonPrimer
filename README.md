R-1.1 Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two integer
values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.
[solution](r-1-1-multiple.py)

R-1.2 Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.
[solution](r-1-2-even.py)

R-1.3 Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of
one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the
form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or
max in implementing your solution
[solution](r-1-3-minmax.py)

R-1.4 Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns
the sum of the squares of all the positive integers smaller than n.
[solution](r-1-4-sum_of_squares.py)

R-1.5 Give a single command that computes the sum from Exercise R-1.4, relying on Python’s comprehension syntax and the built-in sum function.
[solution](r-1-5-sqaure_sum_funct.py)

R-1.6 Write a short Python function that takes a positive integer n and returns
the sum of the squares of all the odd positive integers smaller than n.
[solution](r-1-6-sum_square_odd.py)

R-1.7 Give a single command that computes the sum from Exercise R-1.6, relying on Python’s comprehension syntax and the built-in sum function.
[solution](r-1-7-compreh_sum_square_odd.py)

R-1.8 Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used for index −n ≤ k < 0, what is the equivalent index j ≥ 0 such that s[j] references
the same element?
